## Reflections

This project was the second app I've built.  Learning / using  Angular2 was, as with any new language, a challenge. However,
I found writing in Typescript quite nice, especially when using the Visual Studio code editor. It was also a great refresher 
on using API's, as it is important to have a firm grasp on API's. I am truly getting the hang of SASS / CSS3 / HTML 5.
After so much use, it really goes to show that repitition and practice are the key to learning to code efficiently.
